a query string is formed thusly:

	?name=Thomas

	the questionmark and name are the variable
	the value is thomas

	write it in the url bar in browser

echo will write to the screen (php)
$_GET will store the query variables in an array, like AS3
	an index array is a number [6]
	an associative array is a string ["six"]
